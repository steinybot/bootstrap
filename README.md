# bootstrap

To setup up a new machine run:

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steinybot/bootstrap/main/bootstrap.sh)
```

If Nix is already installed then you can just run the setup with:

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steinybot/bootstrap/main/setup.sh)
```
